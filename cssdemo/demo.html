    	<center>But I'm not sure about that. Even when (Jeff: I am.) you say that... Well, okay. You say that perhaps it kills artists and artists are devalued, and people who have the courage to bare their souls and to be poetic in public and to say 'I care' about something, 'I'm passionate' about something... They also get eulogized. They also get followed down the street, or people swarming you...

Jeff: Sure, but either adored or damned, but never really understood. Because people, sometimes, throw a light... they let these artists carry a light that they refuse to carry for themselves, sometimes. And I've done it. I will do it. You meet someone and you admire them, and you're like 'I can't do that...' I'll still do it, it's a human thing. I mean, it's why they killed Jesus. I mean, why do you stick a man on a stick? Why? Why? Why, because he's... supposedly the Messiah. Why do you inflict such cruelty, what is it that you're getting away from, what is it that you're denying, what is it that you're trying to kill? 

Well in his case, he was not a special case. That was just the torture of the day.

Jeff: I know, but he's the only one that we remember. And for some reason he's remembered as being on the cross. He's not seen as like, this beautiful young man with a lot of understanding. He's always martyred, he will always be bleeding. For all eternity. 

Yeah but we could talk about that for 2 hours because...

Jeff: That's the same, it's the same thing with artists. Same thing. Same exact thing. It's the same exact thing. I mean, I feel it, and I wish I could explain it better.
