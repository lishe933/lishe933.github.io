			<p class="page4">You lie and you both sit down for breakfast quietly together. You watch the morning news together. Slowly as the day goes on after you both tend to your garden, you begin to see everything differently. Things are distorting. <br> Night has come and you and your wife are getting ready for bed, but suddenly you begin to hear voices whispering upstairs. You halt brushing your teeth and make your way upstairs. You hear voices in the spare bedroom and you open the door. </p>
