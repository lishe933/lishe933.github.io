			<p class="page4">The door creaks open and you walk through the doorway. No one is in there untl you turn around and see someone in the hallway whispering to you. Telling you things. Lots of things. A constant thread of things to do and then repeating the same action over and over. The figure draws to you and hovers over you, commanding you to act as it says, repeating the phrase louder and louder.
