        <p><font size="5" color="gold" style="font-family:Arial Black;">Life for me back at home is to be constantly, day by day, next to my dad studying graphic design all around from looking at magazines, studying programs, listening to his lectures, getting yelled at by him if I fuck up something he taught me before, etc. <br> No joke but I still love the old man. </font></p>
