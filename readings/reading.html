 Bill Atkinson’s work with Apple’s user interface helped give the company an edge that allowed it to surpass its competitors in the early days of PC engineering. When Atkinson was joined by Larry Tesler to work further on Apple’s user interface, the two worked around the clock expanding the possible ways in which Apple’s users could interact with the Mac. Bill Verplank’s ideas involving the design process center around the paradigm and a multitude of other factors that play into the overall interaction experience. Verplank’s four M process explains that through, Motivation, Meaning, Modes and Mapping that the Interaction Designer will create a successful interactive experience. This translates visually the the “Haptic Paper” which is a illustrative process the interaction designer can conjure when needed to follow through the process of creating a successful interactive experience

When it comes to interaction and the systems that allow it to be processed into different situations there is too much emphasis on creating a system that can overlap for all types of interaction. However, when the question of “should these systems learn from the user?” come into play and the apparent shift towards a more biological system that adapts to the interaction of the user is considered then there becomes a broader sense of not only opportunity but also logistics of the system its self and what becomes of a system when it is more “biological”. The farthest these systems can shifted to becoming more biological without becoming so is through their creators learning more of the natural systems and interactions at work within natural and the senses that we have, appealing to those to instigate interactions of whatever is desired. These systems really shouldn’t adapt to the user and learn from them as this creates an unpredictable reliance on these technological systems that like nature cannot be completely controlled. If anything, self efficient systems should be monitored within these systems to a heightened degree as these are separate environments for users to interact within, learning from natural systems such as the water cycle so that when a user is introduced to the environment, their presence is more so in awe of the actual system itself.

Sina Bahram’s introduction with his own blindness allows the audience to understand his perspective even more. The main point that Bahram is making is that there is always a “separate” interface to adhere to any users that do not fit with the target audience. Merging experiences so that users that are inhibited do not have to suffer by being unable to participate in “normal” interfaces that everyone else is able to participate in. For me, it makes me feel that we should do this already by creating things that are tolerant of all other aspects, giving into the assumption that “anything could go wrong”. Users will do a lot of things that are beyond what you envisioned and as a designer it should be their duty to create things that are tolerant of subjection rather than restricting the possible actions that users may do.
